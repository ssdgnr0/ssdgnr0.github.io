                      Thank you for visiting! I hope you find in here, that which you may be looking for.<br/>
                      I am deep fanatic of practical  theory and theoratical practicality.<br/>
                      I love systematic operations and the idea of mechanical interactions.<br/>
                      Detail usually awakens me to questioning and giving a hand through it's phasing processes.<br/>
                      Like art is the display of a dimensional construction translating a concept, programming is the<br/>
                      the science of displaying dimensional concept into a construction that is translating into well constructed<br/> 
                      concept. I am an application and game developer now adding web development to my skill set. I have been programming before the<br/> 
                      whole code is cool thing happend. <br/>
                      Back when indie game devs had to settle for Microsoft's XNA framework and write thier own shaders <br/> 
                      if they wanted their games to look two tenths as good as triple a games.<br/>
                      back when Bill Gates was the programer stereo type,<br/>
                      before "cool" kids became programmers.  <br/>
                      I have experience in  C#, python, java, HTML, CSS, SQL, XML and javascript..<br/> 
                      AI is my field of choice but breaking into the direct field has been challanging so far.
